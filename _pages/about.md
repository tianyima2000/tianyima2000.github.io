#### About me
I am a PhD student at the [Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) and [Prof Tengyao Wang](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/wangt60/). Previously, I obtained my MMath and BA degrees in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in July 2023. This year, I am also organising the [Statistics Clinic](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/clinic/statistics-clinic).

#### Research interests
I am broadly interested in statistics and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in providing theoretical guarantees for problems inspired by modern machine learning methods, such as theories for deep learning and in-context learning. I am also interested in nonparametric statistics and missing data problems.
